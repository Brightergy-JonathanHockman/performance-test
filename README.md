# performance-test
Basic timing tests of various languages and frameworks

### Intro

The basic idea for now is to test few of the tasks on various programming languages using the core features and the lowest level libraries whenever needed and also on one or two web frameworks written on top of each of these languages. I want to see how each of them perform.

Language                    | Version                   | Frameworks/Stack
--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------
Javascript          | Nodejs runtime v. 4.4.1 & 5.9.1   | MEAN stack
Elixir              | v. 1.2.3                          | Phoenix and Sugar
Ruby                | v. 2.3.0                          | Sinatra v. 1.4.7
Golang              | v. 1.6                            | Gin v. 1.0rc1, Martini
